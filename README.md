# Slogo Team 7

A development environment that helps users write SLogo programs.

* Team Members & Responsibilities
    * Vincent Liu
        * Nearly all the view components in frontend except for animation
        * Connecting backend with the frontend through external API
    * Harry Xie
        * Command classes
        * Storage system
        * Recursion
        * Turtle
    * Ben Xu
        * Turtle Display window
        * Multiple Turtle manipulation/management framework
        * Turtle animation and processing queue
        * Front end internal API functionality integration
    * Jos√© San Martin
        * ?
* Dates you started, date you finished, and an estimate of the number of hours worked on the project
    * Start Date: 10.15.2018
    * End Date: 10.29.2018
    * Estimate Hours: 180+
* Files used to test the project and errors you expect your program to handle without crashing
    * Run example commands from _data/examples_ to test basic functions.
* Data or resource files required
    * FrontEnd/resources (Mark this as the resource root)
    * BackEnd/resources
* Run the program
    * Note
        * Vincent spent over 5 hours in total trying to figure out the module settings,
        but because of its complexity with this particular project, we decided to use two parallel 
        modules FrontEnd and BackEnd. Essentially, FrontEnd folder is our main folders which require some
        components from BackEnd folder to run.
    * Procedures
        1. Set FrontEnd/resources as the resource root
        2. In the module setting, import two modules: FrontEnd and BackEnd
        3. Go to FrontEnd module's dependency setting, add BackEnd module as its dependency
        4. Go to FrontEnd/src/main/Main.java, run it
* Reference
    * [Yanbo Fang's Repository](https://github.com/yanbofang/slogo/tree/master/src)
    * [IntelliJ's guide about modules](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-modules.html). We tried
    very hard but it still did not work.
    * https://www.oodesign.com/command-pattern.html
    * https://www.oodesign.com/memento-pattern.html
* Assumptions:
    * Everything is a double, except for the remainder method
    * Lists (brackets) only work as arguments. Therefore, you can't say something like "[ fd 50 ]" because there is no top level commands here.
    * When assigning variables in Make/Set or in loop functions, the variable name must start with "
        * For example, to set 5 to a variable var, the command would be 'make "var 5'
    * In order to run a user defined function, the user needs to say "run" and then the name of their function
    * Unlimited parameters: We will create a parenthesis node, and it will act very similar to a
    List node, where the parenthesis node will distribute the command to all of the arguments.
* Any information about using the program
    * There is only one key input, which is the "enter" key. Press it when you are ready to run a command in the command textfield.
* Any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality
    * When encountering an error, need to restart the program. Otherwise, even valid commands will report errors.
* Any extra features included in the project
    * When the mouse is hovering above the turtle, it displays the state of the turtle
    * Multiple tabs can operate at the same time without affecting each other
    * Accordion is used for displaying variable and functions. It makes the tables strechable.
