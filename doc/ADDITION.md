# Estimation: before looking at the old code:

- how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
  - About 1 hour
- how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
  - Add:
    - TurtleImageView -> to display all images of all turtle
  - Edit:
    - View -> I need to add the new view inside the GridPane and add internal methods to add images
    - DisplayView -> add the image of default and newly added turtle onto the TurtleImageView
    - TurtleManager -> this class needs to call View to add image to the TurtleImageView
