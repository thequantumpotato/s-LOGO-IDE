1. What is the result of parsing and who receives it?
    * The result of parsing is a set of commands that are able       to be understood by our backend.Turtle class. For example, if the
    
    
2. When does parsing need to take place and what does it need to start properly?
3. When are errors detected and how are they reported?
    * Errors that can occur are the command inputted is not valid. For example, the command is misspelled or the syntax is invalid. If that occurs, our interpreter class would catch it, and throw an exception that would prompt the GUI to create an error box. 
5. What do commands know, when do they know it, and how do they get it?
    * Command 
6. How is the GUI updated after a command has completed execution?
    * The commmand history window would get a string from the command input and display it
    * The turtle would move based on the command given
